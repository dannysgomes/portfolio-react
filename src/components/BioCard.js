          I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my
          knowledge and skills in:
        </p>
        <ul className="skills">
          <li className="htmlColor">HTML</li>

          <li className="javaColor">Javascript</li>
          <li className="reactColor">React</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Iâ€™d like to support a company with their Front End Web Development
          needs and am continuing education to increase my programming skills.
          Currently, I am learning the React library. Please see the projects
          below which I built during my time during the Techdegree course and
          after earning my certification!
